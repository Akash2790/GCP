Describe Naming Convension in Python 

How to remove upto nth placed digits from the number, Say in 12345, we need to get 12000 after removing upto 3rd placed digits. 

Which all are valid int 

- 100 
- 1000000 
- 1e10 
- 10_11_221 
- 10_000_000 
- 10_000_0.00 
- 20/5 
- int(20/5) 

What is the output of the following 
a = "data" 
print(f">{a:^4.2}<") 

What is the difference between a is b and a == b 

If a == b is returning true then should the datatype of values which a and b have also be same. 

How to check in a string that all characters are in lowercase 

How to check is a substring is part of the string 

Remove all the leading and trailing whitespace in a string 

Create a banner of 40 characters with "Dhirendra Kumar" as data in the center and char * should be used to fill leading and trailing space. 

How to find the sub-string (sub) count in each string (text) with overlapping occurrences, what that means is if you have a string as `mamamea` and substring is `mam` then count is 2. 

How to check if multiple strings exist in a large string
